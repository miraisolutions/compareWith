# compareWith: RStudio Addins for Enhanced Diff and Merge

**compareWith** is an R package providing user-friendly [RStudio
addins](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) that make it easier to
perform **diff** and **merge** tasks, compared to the limited
functionality offered by RStudio itself, especially with projects under
version control.

Tasks **compareWith** greatly helps with include:

  - Compare differences prior to commit, for individual files or the
    whole project.
  - Inspect and resolve merge conflicts via three-way comparison.
  - Compare two distinct files with each other.

The package relies on [**Meld**](http://meldmerge.org/), a common visual
diff and merge tool.

## Installation

You can install the latest **compareWith** from GitHub using the
[**remotes**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes) package

``` r
remotes::install_github("miraisolutions/compareWith")
```

The required dependency [Meld](http://meldmerge.org) is available for
most Linux/Unix distributions and can be easily installed there,
e.g.Â via `sudo apt-get install meld` on **Debian/Ubuntu**.

On **Windows**, its installation is supported by an MSI installer,
downloadable from the Meld website. After installation, you may have to
add the location of the installed `meld.exe` to the `PATH` environment
variable.

Meld is not yet officially supported on **MacOS**. However, it can be
installed via MacPorts, Fink or Brew, making sure `meld` can be launched
from the command line.

## Usage

The functionality of **compareWith** is accessible in RStudio using the
*Addins* menu.
